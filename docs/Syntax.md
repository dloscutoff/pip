# Pip syntax

The syntax of Pip is generally C-like with strong influence from Python, Perl/PHP, and various golfing languages. A few features are reminiscent of Bash script or Lisp.

### Tokens

Tokens in Pip can be any of the following:

 - Number (consecutive digits, optionally followed by a period and more consecutive digits)
 - String literal (between "double quotes")
 - Single-character string literal (a ' single quote followed by any character--no escapes)
 - Escaped string literal (between \"escaped quotes\"--allows literal double quotes as well as variable interpolation)
 - Pattern literal (between \`backticks\`--backslash escapes for backtick & backslash)
 - Operator (one or more symbols or uppercase letters)
 - Lowercase identifier (a single lowercase letter; runs of lowercase letters become multiple identifiers)
 - Uppercase identifier (one or two uppercase letters which are not an operator)
 - Underscore (identity function; see below)
 - Delimiters (parens, square braces, curly braces, semicolon)

### Parsing
Because uppercase identifiers and operators are limited to two characters, the scanner breaks a longer run of them into multiple tokens. For example, `LCAZ` is equivalent to `LC AZ`. If the run contains an odd number of characters, it is interpreted as having a single-character token at the beginning: `PLCAZ` is `P LC AZ`.

### String literals
Escaped string literals warrant further explanation. The delimiter is `\"`, and therefore literal double quotes can be placed inside the string without escaping them (`\"like "this"\"`). Backslashes do need to be escaped with a second backslash (unlike in regular string literals). A backslash followed by an identifier is a variable interpolation: for example, `\"Value is \v.\"` This usage is syntactic sugar for `(J["Value is ";STv;"."])`. Expressions cannot be interpolated at present.

### Comments
Comments come in two types: lines that start with a (possibly indented) semicolon, and anything at the end of a line if preceded by two or more spaces.

<pre>; This is a comment.
x:42  This is a comment too.</pre>

### Whitespace
Whitespace is not significant except for indicating comments and separating tokens.

For example, `(- -5)` returns 5,

But `(--5)` returns 4 because `--` is the decrement operator.

### Types

There are 6 data types in Pip:

 - **Scalar** represents strings and numbers, similar to scalar variables in Perl. A string in numeric context is converted to a number by taking the leading run of digits, possibly with a minus sign or decimal point.
 - **List** is similar to lists in Python: dynamically resizeable, can hold items of any type including other lists, etc.
 - **Range** has a lower and upper bound, and usually represents all integers >= the lower bound and < the upper bound. `5,10` is functionally equivalent to `[5 6 7 8 9]` in most contexts, but potentially more efficient since the numbers need not all be generated. Infinite ranges can be created by passing an upper bound of nil. Ranges are also used for string/array slicing, in which context negative indices may be used: `"Hello"@(1,-1)` == `"ell"`.
 - **Pattern** represents regular expressions and replacement patterns. See [Regex operations](regex).
 - **Block** represents a code block or function.
 - **Nil** is a singleton type, similar to `null` or `None` from other languages. Note that many situations that would cause a runtime error in other languages (such as dividing by zero) simply return nil in Pip (unless warnings are turned on using the -w or -d flags). Most operators, when given nil as an operand, return nil.

Boolean expressions return `0` and `1`. The values `0` (and variants like `0.0`), `""`, `[]`, <code>``</code>, and nil are falsy; all others are truthy.

Many operators, including arithmetic and most string operators, function memberwise on ranges and lists, similar to array-programming languages like APL. For example, `[1 2 3]+[6 5 4]` is `[7 7 7]`, and `"Hello".1,3` is `["Hello1" "Hello2"]`.

Most operators can be used to construct lambda expressions from the identity function `_`. For instance, `3*_+1` is a function equivalent to `{3*a+1}`. This does not work with certain operators, particularly logic operators and operators that otherwise take functions as operands (such as `M` or `R`).

## General Program Syntax

Programs consist of a series of statements that are executed one by one. Bare expressions also count as statements. If the program ends with a bare expression, its value is automatically printed. To suppress printing, end the program with a statement or a nil expression. **Note**: `P` and `O` are operators, not statements, so code like `P"abcd"` at the end of the program will print twice. Use `"abcd"` instead.

Expressions use infix operators; precedence/associativity may be coerced using parentheses. Basic operators are mostly chosen to coincide with familiar ones from C, Python, or Perl/PHP: `+-*/%!?` are as expected; comparison operators chain, as in Python; `.`, `X`, and string comparison operators are borrowed from Perl, `//` integer division and `**` exponentiation from Python. A few potential "gotchas":

 - `&` and `|` are logical, not bitwise operators
 - The assignment operator is `:`, freeing up `=` to be the (numeric) equality operator
 - Ternary operators do not have a symbol between their second and third arguments: `a?"Yes""No"`
 - Increment `++` and decrement `--` are pre- only (i.e. you can do `++x` but not `x++`)

Lists are constructed via square braces: `[1 2 3]`. No separator is necessary, except in cases of ambiguity in scanning or parsing: `[-1 2 3]` works as expected, but `[1 -2 3]` is actually `[-1 3]` because the `-` is treated as a binary operator if possible. Here, the expression terminator `;` can be used to eliminate the ambiguity: `[1;-2 3]`. (`;` can also be useful with ternary operators: `a?1;-1`.) By default, all elements are concatenated together when a list is printed, but there are several [Command-line flags](cli-flags) that provide different formats.

As in C, assignments are valid expressions that can be used anywhere an expression can be used: in a loop test, for example. Appending a colon to any operator turns it into a compound assignment operator: `x+:5` is equivalent to `x:x+5`. This also works with unary and ternary operators: `-:x` flips the sign of the variable.

Another meta-operator is `$`, fold. Prepended to a binary operator, it turns it into a unary fold operation on that operator: e.g., `$+[1 2 3 4]` gives 10. **Note**: the precedence of the compound operator is the same as that of the original binary operator, so `$.[1 2]+3` is interpreted as `$.([1 2]+3)` == `$.[4 5]` == 45. Folding respects the associativity of the operator: `$**[2 3 4]` is `2**(3**4)`, not `(2**3)**4`. Furthermore, folding on a chaining comparison operator results in a chaining comparison: `$>[9 8 7]` is `9>8>7` (true), not `(9>8)>7` (equiv to `1>7`, false).

When `*` is appended to a unary operator, it becomes a map meta-operator: `#[123 4567]` gives the length of the list, `2`, but `#*[123 4567]` gives `[3 4]`, the length of each item in the list.

The `$` and `*` meta-operators leave the precedence of the operator unchanged, but `:` changes the precedence to the precedence of the assignment operator. Meta-operators can be combined: `$+*:x` sums over each item in `x` and assigns the resulting list back to `x`. If `*` and `:` are both present, `*` must come first.

As in C, loops and if statements use curly braces to mark off their blocks, and the curly braces can be dropped if the block is a single statement.

Curly braces are also used to construct functions, which are first-class objects and can be assigned to variables, passed to other functions, etc. Functions are called via a Lisp-like syntax: `(fxyz)` calls the function `f` with arguments `x`, `y`, and `z`. (This syntax makes parsing much, much easier!) If the `(fxyz)` syntax is used with `f` being a list, scalar, or range rather than a function, it is an alternate syntax for subscripting: `(lij)` is equivalent to `l@i@j`, or `l[i][j]` in most languages.

Within a function, the arguments are available through the local variables `a-e`. For example, the function `{a+b}` takes two arguments and adds them; it could be called like so: `({a+b}1 2)`, or assigned to a variable first. The local variable `g` contains the entire list of arguments that were passed in (mnemonic: ar**g**s). The local variable `f` contains a reference to the current function, allowing recursion even in anonymous functions. Functions do not have a set arity, although a function cannot be called with zero arguments. The last bare expression in a function is its return value. If a function does not end in an expression, it returns nil.

The main program is an implicitly declared anonymous function, which gets its arguments from the command-line args and prints its return value. Thus, a full factorial program can be written using recursion as `a?a*(fa-1)1`--identical to a factorial function, just without the curly braces.

The `M` operator is used to map a function to each element of a list, range, or scalar: `_*_ M ,5` gives `[0 1 4 9 16]`. The result is always a list, although there are also operators like `MJ` "map-join" and `MS` "map-sum" that perform further operations on the result list after mapping.
